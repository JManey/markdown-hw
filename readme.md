# This is a _cheatsheet_ for bash commands.

## Commands _I've_ used so far:

1. ___touch___: is used to make a file
1. ___mkdir___: is used to make a folder
1. ___mv___: is used to move a file or folder.  If moving a folder you need the flag __-R__(recursive) to move the folder and contents.  _mv_ is also the way to rename files or folders, just move it the same or another directory and change the name, it will copy the file with the new name.
1. ___cd ~____ will take you to your home directory
1. ___ls___ will list files in the current directory
1. ___pwd___ will print your current working directory in the terminal
1. ___&&___ can be used to join two commands together, ex. cd ~/sample-folder && touch new-file-txt
1. ___rm___: stands for remove and is how we remove files.  If you need to remove a directory and its files you must use rm -RF(recursive and force([hmm not sure if you have to use the F](https://www.macworld.com/article/2082021/master-the-command-line-deleting-files-and-folders.html)).
1. You can perform more than one common action at a time: ex. touch index.txt page2.html page3.html
